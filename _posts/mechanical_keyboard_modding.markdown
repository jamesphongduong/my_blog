# Modding my first mechanical keyboard 

## Motivation
Since I type alot, I wanted to further experience my typing experience. After rabbit holing into the world of mechanical keyboards, I decided to implement 3 modifications to my Keychron K2V2 keyboard.

## The Mods

There's a whole bunch of different mods you can do, but since this was my first time modding, I wanted to keep it simple. Hence I chose 3 mods to implement which cost me $30 overall. 

1. Lube each keyboard switches (this makes the switches more smoother to press, and has a buttery feel to them)
   - 1x Krytox Lube 205g0 ($16.20 - $10 + shipping and tax from DailyClack)
2. Add padding inside the keyboard (this extra layer helps dampen the sound)
   - 1x felt padding sheet (free, had a random piece from online shopping package padding)
3. Add film (extra layer of material) to each individual keyboard switch (reduces switch wobble)
   - 1x Switch Film ($13.80 from Ebay)
