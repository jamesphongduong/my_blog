A computer has 2 places for data storage:

# 1. Memory - AKA RAM (random access memory)

Used to temporarily store and access data on a _short-term_ storage and be accessed _quickly_. If the computer has to "think", it uses RAM. Examples include running a program, webpage, or a video game, all that data is stored in RAM. Data is stored on RAM sticks. When the computer is off, the RAM is empty.

# 2. Storage

Used for _long-term_ storage. Everything that your computer "knows", but isn't thinking about. Examples include saved files and installed programs. Data is stored on Hard Disk Drives (HDD) or Solid State Drives (SSD). When the computer is off, the data is retained.
