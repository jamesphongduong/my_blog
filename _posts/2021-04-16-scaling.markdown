Scalability in system design looks at how we handle increased demand by adding additional resources to our current system. We can scale horizontally and/or vertically.

_Horizontal scaling_ is when you add more nodes to your system.

_Vertical scaling_ is when you increase the resources of a single node, usually upgrading the amount of CPUs, memory or storage.

# Comparison

| Horizontal                                               | Vertical                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| - Load balancer required                                 | - N/A                                |
| - Resilient - load balancer can reroute failing requests | - Single point of failure            |
| - Remote Procedure Calls (slow)                          | - Inter process communication (fast) |
| - Data inconsistency                                     | - Consistent data                    |
| - Scales well                                            | - Hardware limitations               |
| - Cost increases exponentially                           | - Cost increases linearly            |

# In Practice

The best system for scale would be a hybrid implementation, taking pros from both.

Starting off, it would make sense to initially scale vertically, (due to simplicity and cost) and then scale horizontally. (once required)
